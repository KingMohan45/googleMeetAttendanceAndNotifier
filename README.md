# Google meet attendance & message notifier
This is mainly useful for those who want to collect attendees list and with some more cool features. I personally created this website with help of online regerence for some concepts like MutationObserver especially for my college RGUKT RKV.

Video regarding installation and usage : https://youtu.be/GesqoOMmHkg
Features:
* Records person's session-time(how many minutes a person stayed on page)
* if someone messages even if you aren't active on that tab you will get a desktop notification
* one can start or stop recording by default it will be started
* one can download CSV file with id (if any), names and session times separated by ',' at any instance of time
** those were working at the time of publishing(as of observed tests), feel free to mail(mohanragam456@gmail.com) me issues if any.
